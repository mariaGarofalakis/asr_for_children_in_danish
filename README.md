# ASR_for_children_in_danish
I implement an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system in order to transcribe children voices in danish.The whole implementation was based on the fine-tuning of  "chcaa/xls-r-300m-danish-nst-cv9"  which is a Wev2Vec2 model fine-tuned for adults speaking in danish.


# Execution
Firstly is recomented to create a python virtual enviroment and install all project's requirements. To install all project requirements cd to asr_for_children_in_danish (base directory) and execute:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will download and install all the required python packages in order to execute this project. Moving on in the same directory (asr_for_children_in_danish) execute the commant:
```
asr_for_children_in_danish
```
