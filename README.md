# ASR_for_children_in_danish
I implement an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system in order to transcribe children voices in danish.The whole implementation was based on the fine-tuning of  "chcaa/xls-r-300m-danish-nst-cv9"  which is a Wev2Vec2 model fine-tuned for adults speaking in danish.


# Execution
Firstly is recomented to create a python virtual enviroment and install all project's requirements there in order to do so execute the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python set_up.py install -e
```
